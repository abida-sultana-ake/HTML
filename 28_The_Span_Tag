            <h1>WHY CAR IS LOVE</h1>
            <p>A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people over cargo</p>

                <h1>What about BMW</h1>
                <p>The BMW M4 is a high-performance version of the BMW 4 Series automobile developed by BMW's motorsport division, BMW M, that has been built since 2014. As part of the renumbering that splits the coup√© and convertible variants of the 3 Series into the 4 Series, the M4 replaced those variants of the BMW M3. Upgrades over the standard BMW 4 Series include an upgraded engine, suspension, exhaust system, brakes and weight reduction measures including increased use of carbon fibre, such as on the roof of the car.</p>
